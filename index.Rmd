Katherine M. Pag√°n Rivera graduated from the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao, where she double majored in coastal marine biology and wildlife management. Her main area of interest is ecology, especially in estuarine systems and the great variety of factors that can influence and alter them. In addition to this, she has a particular interest in aquatic invertebrates. Among some of her research roles, she worked with deep sea image analysis to obtain the biomass of benthic macroinvertebrates in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone in the Pacific Ocean. Before her position at UNH, she worked with local hands-on volunteer efforts such as coast monitoring for sea turtles nesting. You can find her diving, snorkeling, or walking with her cat in her free time.
